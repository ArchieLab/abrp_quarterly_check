# Create the quarterly swerb report 

With this code you can generate the quartely report for the swerb data. 
Open the R project and then the swerb_quartely_report file inside the ./reports folder.
Inside swerb_quartely_report.rdm you have to update the end_of_quarter variable towards the top of the code.
Then you can knit the file and it will produce the document.
