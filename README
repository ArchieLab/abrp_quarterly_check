# Create the quarterly swerb report 

You need to have a vpn connection to Duke and a ssh tunnel to the server.
ssh -L 22222:localhost:5432 DUKEUSERNAME@papio.biology.duke.edu

With this code you can generate the quartely report for the swerb data. 
Open the R project and then the swerb_quartely_report file inside the ./reports folder.
Inside swerb_quartely_report.rdm you have to update the end_of_quarter variable towards the top of the code.
Then you can knit the file and it will produce the document.
